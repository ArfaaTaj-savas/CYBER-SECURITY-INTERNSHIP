# Task 3: Basic Vulnerability Scan

## Objective
The goal of this task was to perform a basic vulnerability scan on my personal computer to identify common security risks using free tools.

## Tools Used
* **Scanner:** Nessus Essentials
* **Platform:** Kali Linux (running in a VMware VM)
* **Target:** My host PC (IP: 192.168.140.2)

## Process
1.  Installed Nessus Essentials on the Kali Linux VM.
2.  Configured a "Basic Network Scan" targeting my host machine's IP address (`192.168.140.2`).
3.  Launched the scan and waited for it to complete.
4.  Analyzed the generated report to identify vulnerabilities.

## Summary of Findings
* *(You will fill this in after the scan is complete.)*
* *(Example: The scan identified 5 vulnerabilities, with 1 'High' and 4 'Medium'.)*
