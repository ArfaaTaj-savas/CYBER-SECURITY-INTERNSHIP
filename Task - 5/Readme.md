# Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

[cite_start]This repository contains the submission for Task 5 of the Elevate Labs Cybersecurity Internship[cite: 1, 2]. The task involves capturing live network traffic using Wireshark, analyzing it, and identifying common protocols.

## üéØ Objective

[cite_start]The objective is to capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types to gain hands-on packet analysis skills[cite: 6, 17].

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

* [cite_start]**Wireshark:** A free and open-source packet analyzer[cite: 6].

## üìã Steps Taken

[cite_start]As per the task guidelines[cite: 8], the following steps were performed:

1.  [cite_start]**Install Wireshark:** Wireshark was downloaded and installed from the official website[cite: 9].

2.  [cite_start]**Select Interface & Start Capture:** After launching Wireshark, the active network interface (e.g., `Wi-Fi` or `Ethernet`) was selected, and the packet capture was started by clicking the "shark fin" icon[cite: 10].

3.  **Generate Network Traffic:** To generate meaningful data to capture, I performed two actions:
    * Opened a web browser and visited `http://example.com`.
    * [cite_start]Opened a terminal/command prompt and ran the command `ping google.com`[cite: 11].

4.  [cite_start]**Stop Capture:** After approximately one minute of capturing this traffic, the capture was stopped[cite: 12].

5.  **Analyze and Filter Packets:** The captured packets were analyzed. [cite_start]To find specific protocols, I used Wireshark's display filter bar[cite: 13].

6.  [cite_start]**Export Capture:** The complete packet capture was saved and exported as a `.pcap` file, which is included in this repository[cite: 15, 7].

## üìä Results and Protocols Identified

[cite_start]By filtering the captured traffic, I successfully identified several different protocols as required[cite: 14].

### 1. DNS (Domain Name System)
* **Filter Used:** `dns`
* **Findings:** I observed "Standard query" packets from my computer asking for the IP addresses of `google.com` (for the ping) and `example.com` (for the browser). These were followed by "Standard query response" packets from the DNS server providing the corresponding IP addresses.

### 2. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
* **Filter Used:** `tcp`
* **Findings:** A large volume of TCP traffic was seen, primarily related to browsing `example.com`. I was able to observe the **TCP 3-Way Handshake** (`[SYN]`, `[SYN, ACK]`, `[ACK]`) that established the connection between my browser and the web server.

### 3. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
* **Filter Used:** `http`
* **Findings:** Because `http://example.com` is an unencrypted website, I could clearly see the `GET / HTTP/1.1` request packet sent from my computer to the server. This was followed by an `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` packet from the server, which contained the HTML content of the webpage.

### 4. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
* **Filter Used:** `icmp`
* **Findings:** This traffic was generated by the `ping google.com` command. I identified a series of "Echo (ping) request" packets sent by my machine and corresponding "Echo (ping) reply" packets coming back from Google's server.
